# Contribution Guideline

This series of documents is dedicated to people whom want to understand
the codebase, architecture, and the contribution guideline.

### Reporting issues

Include the following information in your post:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- Describe what actually happened. Include server logs or any error that browser shows.
- If possible, post your xray json config file and what you have set in env (by censoring critical information).
- Also tell the version of Marzneshin, Xray and docker (if you use docker) you are using.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}

Please don't open issues solely intended to **questions**. Instead, use one of the following ways to ask:

- Ask on our telegram group: [@marzneshins](https://t.me/marzneshins)
- Ask on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/khodedawsh/marzneshin/discussions) for long term discussion or
  larger questions.

### Submitting a Pull Request

If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer opening one for discussion before working on a PR. You
can work on any issue that doesn't have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned to it. These show up in the
sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on an issue that interests you.

#### Branches

Make sure to create a branch off your master branch, and then submit a PR to our master branch.
