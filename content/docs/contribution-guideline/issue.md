Avoid mutual waste of time by following these simple rules:

1. **One Issue, One Problem**  
   Do not report multiple problems in a single issue. Any issue containing more than one problem will be closed.

2. **No Duplicates**  
   Duplicate issues will be closed immediately.

3. **No Personal Support or Questions**  
   Requests for personal support or general questions will either be closed or moved to the Discussions section.

4. **Clear and Detailed Description**  
   The issue must include a clear and well-explained description of the problem.

5. **Specific and Descriptive Titles**  
   Issues must have a specific, descriptive, and relevant title. Avoid vague or general titles, and do not submit issues without a title. Issues with unclear titles will be closed.
