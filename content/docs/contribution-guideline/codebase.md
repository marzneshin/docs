## Project Structure

To rewrite the provided folder structure using the `filetree` notation based on the documentation in the image, the code will look like this:

{{< filetree/container >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="marzneshin" state="open">}}
{{< filetree/folder name="app" >}}
Backend code
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="dashboard" >}}
Frontend Code
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="cli" >}}
CLI Code
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}}

| Folder name | Description                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `app`       | Backend code (FastAPI - Python)    |
| `dashboard` | Frontend code (React - Typescript) |
| `cli`       | CLI code (Typer - Python)          |

## Backend

Backend is built using FastAPI and uses SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database operations. Pydantic models can be found
in the `app/models` directory, while all database-related operations and models are in the `app/db` directory. The
migration scripts for the database (Alembic) can be found in the `app/db/migrations` directory.

### Python Code Formatting

To maintain consistency in the codebase, we require all code to be formatted using

```bash
black .
```

## Frontend

The frontend follows a feature-oriented development structure. Features are essentially
components, hooks, logics, services which provide user-experience that it coupled with domain
and UI functionality.

{{< filetree/container >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="routes" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="features" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="users" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="nodes" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="hosts" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="entity-table" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="github-repo" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="components" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="ui" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}}

| Folder name    | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `routes`       | @tanstack/react-router routing |
| `features`     | Feature folder                 |
| `users`        | Core domain feature            |
| `nodes`        | Core domain feature            |
| `hosts`        | Core domain feature            |
| `entity-table` | Support feature                |
| `github-repo`  | Support feature                |
| `components`   | Generic Components             |
| `ui`           | Atomic components              |

### Features

`features` folder encapsulate all features. Features can be categorized in few groups, **Core domain**, **Support**.
Core domain features deliver a set of solutions to the problem the application intened to resolve. Meanwhile
Support features provide a set of solutions that are independent from domain model, however, they are necessary
for the application to fully deliver the experience the user expect.

### Generic Components

`components` folder is a place for react generic components that will be reused by features.
The same logic goes for `hooks`, `types`, folder.

### Atomic components

`components/ui` folder is a place for atomic components that are the backbone of the application.
These components are based on shadcn component template, however, depending when you are reading this,
we probably have diverged a lot.

### Utils

These functions are generic and reused across codebase, although, they will be transfered to their
own generic folder or feature folder as they grow in complexity and code usage.

### Routes and pages

`routes` folder is tanstack routing folder, containg pages and routing logic.

To build the frontend you'll need the following dependencies:

- pnpm

then run `make dashboard-deps && make dashboard build` for it to build; or `make dashboard-dev` for development
purposes.

## Marzneshin CLI

Marzneshin CLI is built using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and its commands' code can be found in `cli`
directory. Its documentation is generated using [Typer CLI](https://typer.tiangolo.com/typer-cli/) which can be
re-generated by navigating to project's root directory and running the following command:

```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) typer marzneshin-cli.py utils docs --name "marzneshin-cli" --output ./cli/README.md
```

## Dev Mode

To run the frontend in development mode use the following commands to install the dependencies, and then run the
backend:

```bash
make dashboard-deps && make dashboard-dev
```

run `make start` in another console.
